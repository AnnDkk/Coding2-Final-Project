## Introduction

This project creates a seemingly stable and harmonious space. However, with the constant fluctuation of the texture in the middle, the particles emitted gradually make people feel a sense of chaos, disorder and anxiety. After touching the Arduino, the red light flashes with the particle to stop releasing and return to the brief tranquility when it is still needed to maintain the state.
